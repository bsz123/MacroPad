I have about a year and a halfs experience lightly using python. I am moving to college soon and will be primarly using a laptop. 
This is the first project I have done that was for personal use not school or work.

To-Do:
	Design an outer case for the macropad edges
	Macros for my utilities 	

There are a few files that are installed from initial setup of the rp2040.
